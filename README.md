# CustomCommands API
A Minecraft plugin api that aims at easing command development.

## Introduction
The project aims at simplifying code when creating a commands by using java reflection and annotations. This method helps you avoid creating many classes or having complex conditional logic and instead offloads command execution handling to the api internally so you don't have to. Although it is operational at the moment, I look forward to adding more functionalities to this over the summer break.

## Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by ACF's usage of annotations to bypass code repetitivity
